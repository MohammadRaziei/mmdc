"""
mermaidx.pool — parallel batch rendering.

Rendering a Mermaid diagram is pure CPU-bound work (parsing + layout inside
QuickJS): no I/O, nothing to wait on. That rules out asyncio/threads as a
source of real concurrency here — a QuickJS context is pinned to a single
thread anyway (see engine.py), and Python's GIL means extra threads wouldn't
overlap CPU work even if it weren't. The only way to actually use more than
one CPU core is more than one process.

render_many() does exactly that: a process pool where each worker starts
its own persistent Engine once (loading mermaid.js is the expensive part)
and reuses it for every diagram routed to that worker.
