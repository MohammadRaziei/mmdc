mermaidx.engines.v8_engine -- mermaid.js running inside real V8 (via the
`mini-racer` package, imported as `py_mini_racer`) instead of QuickJS-ng.

Same public shape as mermaidx.engines.quickjs_engine on purpose: class name
`Engine`, exception `MermaidRenderError`, and the same
start()/close()/started/render_svg() surface. Switching mermaidx.diagram
between engines is a single import-line change:

    from mermaidx.engines.quickjs_engine import Engine, MermaidRenderError
    # vs.
    from mermaidx.engines.v8_engine import Engine, MermaidRenderError

Why this exists: V8 has a JIT, QuickJS-ng doesn't, so the same real
mermaid.js + dagre layout work runs noticeably faster here (see
benchmark scripts) -- at the cost of a real, documented limitation below.

Why text measurement works differently here
---------------------------------------------
QuickJS lets Python expose a *synchronous* callable straight into JS
(`ctx.add_callable`), so mermaid.js's synchronous `getBBox()`/
`getComputedTextLength()` calls can call straight back into Python for
every single measurement, mid-layout, without anything special.

`py_mini_racer`'s only supported callback mechanism is *async* Python
functions (V8 disallows re-entrant synchronous callbacks into an
embedder for safety/deadlock reasons) -- but mermaid.js calls these DOM
methods synchronously and can't be made to `await` them without editing
mermaid.js itself, which this project deliberately never does.

The fix used here isn't a callback at all: mermaidx.font_metrics.measure()
does nothing but sum per-character advance widths (no kerning, no
ligatures -- see that module's docstring), so instead of measuring text
live, this engine ships the *entire* per-codepoint advance-width table for
both the regular and bold bundled fonts into V8 once at boot
(Font.full_advance_table()), and JS sums it locally. This is not an
approximation -- it reproduces mermaidx.font_metrics.Font.measure() exactly
(same tables, same formula), just computed in JS instead of Python. Any
codepoint outside the table (extremely unlikely -- DejaVu Sans covers
Latin/Greek/Cyrillic/general punctuation/symbols) falls back to the
font's own notdef-glyph width, exactly like the Python path does.

Why this runs in a subprocess, not a thread
---------------------------------------------
quickjs_engine.py bounds runaway diagrams (mindmap/cytoscape's internal
requestAnimationFrame-driven loop, built for a long-lived interactive page,
meaningless for a one-shot headless render) via a capped, step-by-step
job-pump loop. py_mini_racer exposes no equivalent manual microtask-pumping
control -- it drains microtasks automatically inside a single eval() call --
so a diagram type whose JS never naturally stops scheduling work has no
safety valve here and can run past `render_timeout_ms`.

An earlier version of this file ran V8 on a dedicated *thread* and, on
timeout, simply abandoned that thread (Python can't forcibly kill a
thread) and started a fresh one. That "worked" in the sense that
subsequent renders succeeded, but it permanently leaked the abandoned
thread's whole V8 isolate -- measured at ~140-160MB *every single time* --
since nothing was ever able to reclaim it. Testing confirmed
`set_hard_memory_limit()` doesn't help here either: mindmap's actual
animation loop is CPU-bound (it just keeps rescheduling itself), not one
that grows memory, so it never hits any heap ceiling to terminate it early.

A *process* doesn't have this problem: the OS can force-terminate one
unconditionally (`SIGKILL`, which cannot be blocked or ignored) and is
guaranteed to reclaim 100% of its memory immediately, no matter what state
it was stuck in. So the V8 isolate lives in a child process instead of a
thread; on timeout, that child is killed outright (not asked to stop) and
a fresh one is spawned for the next render. A killed render still raises
in the caller, exactly as before, but nothing is leaked afterward.

The child is started via the `spawn` method (a fresh interpreter), not
`fork` -- V8 is documented as unsafe to fork after initialization, and
forking a process that has other live threads (e.g. another Engine's own
child-management thread) is a general, separate correctness hazard on top
of that. `spawn` avoids both.
