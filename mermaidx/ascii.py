"""
mermaidx.ascii — ASCII/Unicode terminal rendering.

Backed by termaid (https://pypi.org/project/termaid/): pure Python, ~700KB,
zero dependencies of its own -- small enough next to quickjs-ng/resvg that
it's a core dependency here rather than an optional extra. No binary blob
and no second JS engine to load, unlike the alternatives (mermaid-ascii is
a Go binary rebundled for PyPI by a third-party repackaging project;
beautiful-mermaid is a JS bundle that would need its own DOM shim loaded
into the QuickJS engine).

Character-cell art doesn't need real font metrics the way SVG layout does,
so this is a completely separate, lightweight code path from the 'js'
backend rather than something built on top of it.
