    A `box <color> <participants>` group in a sequenceDiagram used to crash

    parser first tries `window.CSS.supports("color", name)` to check
    whether the leading word is a real CSS color, only falling back to a
    `new Option().style.color = ...` browser trick when `CSS` is missing --
    QuickJS has neither, so it always hit the unimplementable fallback.

    Fixing just that crash wasn't the whole story, though: the box then
    rendered as an opaque rect covering the *entire* diagram, hiding the
    actors and messages behind it, because mermaid draws the box first and
    calls d3 selection's `.lower()` to push it behind everything appended
    after it -- and `.lower()` silently no-ops without a `previousSibling`
    getter on Node, which the shim never had. So this checks not just that
    rendering succeeds, but that the box rect actually ends up before (i.e.
    behind, in SVG paint order) the actor rects in the document.
